# Frontend Root

React TypeScript dashboard for Ethereum network monitoring and visualization that provides interactive analysis of beacon chain block production and network metrics.

## Core Integration Patterns
- **Multi-Network Support**: Implements network-aware routing with URL-based network selection and fallback defaults
- **Bootstrap Configuration**: Uses runtime configuration loading via `/lab-data/bootstrap` to support deployment flexibility
- **Vite Proxy Development**: Local development uses Vite proxy to backend at localhost:8080 with production bootstrap override

## Build System Architecture
- **Vite + TypeScript**: Fast development server with HMR and TypeScript path mapping
- **Manual Chunk Strategy**: Vendor code separation for optimal caching and bundle splitting
- **TailwindCSS Integration**: Utility-first styling with semantic color system and responsive design
- **API Generation**: Protocol buffer client generation via `generate-api.sh` script before builds

## Production Deployment Constraints
- **Static Asset Serving**: Builds to static files for CDN deployment with nginx routing configuration
- **Backend URL Discovery**: Runtime backend URL resolution supports multiple deployment environments
- **Docker Multi-Stage**: Optimized container builds with nginx serving layer
