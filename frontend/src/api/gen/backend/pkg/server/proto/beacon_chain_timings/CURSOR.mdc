Auto-generated protobuf TypeScript types for beacon chain timing analysis data structures.

- NEVER manually edit generated protobuf files - regenerate using protoc-gen-es instead
- Use TimingData for block timing statistics with percentile breakdowns (p05, p50, p95)
- Use SizeCDFData for cumulative distribution function analysis of block sizes
- All request/response pairs follow standard protobuf patterns with binary/JSON serialization
- State tracking uses network+window_name as composite keys for processor coordination
