Auto-generated TypeScript Protobuf types for tracking Ethereum network node contributors and analytics.

- Generated from `backend/pkg/server/proto/xatu_public_contributors/xatu_public_contributors.proto`
- Provides types for network statistics, user data, geographic distributions, and time-series analytics
- Supports multi-network Ethereum monitoring with time window configurations
- Never modify generated files directly - changes must be made to the source .proto file
