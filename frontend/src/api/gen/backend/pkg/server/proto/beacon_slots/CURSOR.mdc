Auto-generated protobuf TypeScript types for comprehensive beacon chain slot data structures.

- NEVER manually edit generated protobuf files - regenerate using protoc-gen-es instead
- Use BeaconSlotData as the main container with block, proposer, timings, attestations, and MEV data
- SlimTimings vs FullTimings: SlimTimings drops metadata/geo for efficiency
- MEV data includes RelayBids and DeliveredPayloads keyed by relay name
- LocallyBuiltBlock structures track validator-built blocks with comprehensive metadata
- All timing data uses millisecond precision relative to slot start times
