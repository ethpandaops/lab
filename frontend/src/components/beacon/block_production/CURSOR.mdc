# Beacon Block Production Component

Real-time visualization of Ethereum beacon chain block production process with responsive desktop and mobile interfaces.

## Core Integration Pattern

- **View Selection**: Route between `DesktopBlockProductionView` and `MobileBlockProductionView` based on screen size/device type
- **Shared Props Interface**: All views implement `BlockProductionBaseProps` for consistent data flow and prop typing
- **Timeline Context Integration**: Components must consume `useTimeline()` context for real-time state synchronization across views

## Cross-Component Coordination

- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Switch between desktop 3-panel and mobile single-column layouts at appropriate breakpoints
- **Real-time Data Flow**: All child components receive live `currentTime`, `bids`, and `winningBid` props for synchronized state updates
- **Phase State Consistency**: Use shared `getCurrentPhase()` and phase transition logic across desktop/mobile implementations
