# Desktop Block Production View

Desktop-optimized 3-panel layout for visualizing Ethereum beacon chain block production with timeline integration.

## Layout Architecture

- **3-Panel Design**: Builders/Relays (left 20%) → Blockchain Visualization (center 60%) → Continents (right 20%)
- **Conditional Timeline**: Show PhaseTimeline component only when navigation controls are provided (live page mode)
- **Active State Management**: Components transition opacity based on phase timing and activity patterns

## Key Integration Patterns

- All panels coordinate through shared `isActive()` logic that determines component visibility based on block propagation timeline
- Timeline context (`useTimeline`) drives real-time state updates across all visualization components
- FlowStage components handle dense data display with role-specific sorting and rendering optimizations
