Mobile block production visualization with progressive disclosure pattern for touch interfaces.

## Layout Pattern
- Single-column card stack replaces desktop 3-panel layout
- Integrated timeline bar with navigation controls at top
- Progressive activation of stage cards based on block lifecycle timing

## Phase-Based Activation Logic
- Use `isActive(role)` function to determine component visibility/styling
- Calculate dynamic transition times from real node/attestation data
- Apply progressive opacity/color changes during phase transitions
- Maintain visual continuity through phase-based color schemes

## Mobile Navigation Controls
- Slot navigation (prev/next) with disabled states for boundaries
- Live mode toggle with visual distinction when active
- Play/pause timeline control integrated with global timeline context
- Time scrubbing via timeline bar progress indicator

## Progressive Disclosure
- Show minimal info initially, expand detail as phases progress
- Use StageCard component for consistent emoji/title/subtitle/progress pattern
- Apply continent propagation details only when nodes are active
- Integrate progress bars for measurable metrics (attestation percentage)
