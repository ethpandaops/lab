# Layout Components

Primary application shell providing unified navigation, header management, and responsive layout structure.

## Key Patterns
- **Unified Layout System**: Single Layout.tsx component orchestrates entire app shell with sticky header, mobile sidebar, and contextual navigation
- **Responsive Navigation**: Desktop header bar with mobile slide-out sidebar, synchronized network selection and beacon clock display
- **Contextual Header Integration**: Supports both legacy page headers and preferred integrated contextual headers with breadcrumbs and system alerts

## Design Constraints
- Mobile-first responsive design with breakpoint-specific layouts (lg:hidden, lg:block patterns)
- Sticky positioning for header (z-50) with proper mobile menu overlay management
- Network-aware state synchronization across header, navigation, and mobile sidebar components
- Consistent semantic color usage following established frontend color system
