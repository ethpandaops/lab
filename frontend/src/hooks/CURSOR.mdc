# Frontend Hooks

Custom React hooks that provide reusable data fetching and state management with global caching and deduplication patterns.

## Key Patterns

- **Global Cache with Deduplication**: Implement singleton cache objects to prevent duplicate network requests across components
- **Pending Request Tracking**: Track ongoing fetches to avoid duplicate requests when multiple components mount simultaneously
- **Flexible Lookup Functions**: Include helper methods on cached objects for pattern matching and prefix lookups
- **Graceful Fallback**: Always include hardcoded fallback data when external data sources fail
- **Network-Specific Isolation**: Cache data separately per network/environment to prevent cross-contamination

## Implementation Guidelines

- Cache objects should persist outside React component lifecycle
- Initialize state from cache when available to prevent loading flickers
- Use async/await patterns with proper error handling
- Include console logging for debugging data fetch operations
- Normalize data keys for consistent lookups (lowercase, remove 0x prefix)
