# Frontend Source Root

React TypeScript frontend for Ethereum lab monitoring dashboard that visualizes beacon chain block production and network metrics.

## Application Bootstrap Pattern
- Use bootstrap.ts for environment-specific backend URL configuration
- Support dev mode backend override via VITE_BACKEND_URL
- Always validate bootstrap response contains required backend.url

## Multi-Network Architecture
- Implement network selection via URL parameters with fallback to mainnet
- Use ApplicationProvider to cascade network context to all child components
- Maintain network state consistency between URL and application state
- Validate selected network against available networks from config

## Provider Orchestration
- Wrap application in provider hierarchy: ApplicationProvider → ModalProvider → QueryClientProvider
- Initialize providers with bootstrap config and API client before rendering routes
- Use error boundaries at top level for bootstrap and config failures

## Route Structure Conventions
- Use nested routes with Outlet pattern for hierarchical navigation
- Implement redirect routes for backward compatibility
- Place network-aware routes under network-context providers
