React contexts layer that provides centralized state management for beacon chain timing, network selection, API clients, and UI controls.

- **Use consistent context/hook pattern** - `createContext()` with error-checked custom hook for safe access
- **Implement BeaconClock utilities** - Provide precise 12-second slot and 32-slot epoch calculations for all networks  
- **Maintain timeline precision** - 10ms update intervals required for smooth animation, separate display vs state updates
- **Ensure provider error boundaries** - All contexts must throw meaningful errors when used outside providers
- **Support real-time slot monitoring** - Callback subscription pattern for slot change notifications across components
