# Frontend Scripts

API code generation automation using buf protobuf compiler for TypeScript and Connect clients.

## Key Patterns
- Two-phase generation: TypeScript types for all protos, Connect clients for API protos only
- Clean output directory before generation to ensure consistent state
- Operate from project root context with relative path navigation from script location

## Requirements
- buf tool with project-specific template configurations (buf-frontend-types.gen.yaml, buf-frontend-connect.gen.yaml)
- Must run scripts from their containing directory, scripts navigate to project root automatically
- Output directory: frontend/src/api/gen (cleaned before each generation)
