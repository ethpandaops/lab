# EthPandaOps Lab UI

The EthPandaOps Lab is an experimental platform for exploring and visualizing Ethereum network data. This UI component provides interactive visualizations and insights from various data sources.

## Structure

```
├── data/              # JSON data files generated by notebooks
├── frontend/          # React frontend application]
└── notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks for data processing
```

## Data Sources

### Xatu

Xatu is a beacon chain event collector and metrics exporter. The Lab processes data from Xatu to provide insights into:
- Network contributor statistics
- Client version distribution
- Network health metrics

## Development

### Frontend

The frontend is built with:
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts for data visualization
- Vite for development and building

To run the frontend locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server includes a proxy that serves data files from the `../data` directory at the `/api/data` endpoint.

### Data Processing

Data is processed using Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks/` directory. Each notebook:
- Does whatever it needs to do to get the data
- Saves the results as JSON files in the `data/` directory

To run a notebook:

```bash
cd notebooks
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # Configure your environment variables
./run_notebook.sh xatu-public-contributors
```

Notebooks are configured to run on a schedule defined in `notebooks.yaml`. Each notebook has:
- A minimum interval between runs
- Specific data processing tasks
- Output paths for generated data

## Deployment

The frontend is deployed on Cloudflare Pages, providing:
- Global CDN distribution
- Automatic HTTPS
- Continuous deployment from Git
