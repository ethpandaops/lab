Generated Connect-Go RPC bindings for Lab service providing frontend configuration endpoints.

**Key Patterns:**
- Generated code from protobuf definitions - DO NOT manually edit
- Implements Connect RPC protocol for HTTP/gRPC compatibility  
- Provides both client and server interfaces for LabService
- Uses connect.Request/Response wrappers for all RPC calls

**Important Constraints:**
- File is code-generated - regenerate via protoc-gen-connect-go when proto changes
- Maintain backward compatibility when modifying underlying proto definitions
- Client construction requires baseURL and HTTPClient configuration
