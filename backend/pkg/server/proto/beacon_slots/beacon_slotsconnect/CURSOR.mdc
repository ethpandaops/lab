# Beacon Slots Connect

Generated Connect RPC client and server bindings for the beacon slots service.

## Key Integration Pattern

- **Generated code**: This is auto-generated by protoc-gen-connect-go - DO NOT EDIT manually
- **Connect RPC protocol**: Provides HTTP/JSON and gRPC-compatible endpoints from protobuf definitions
- **Client/Handler interfaces**: Exposes BeaconSlotsClient for consumption and BeaconSlotsHandler for implementation

## Critical Constraints

- Generated code - regenerate via protoc command instead of manual edits
- Maintains compatibility with Connect, gRPC, and gRPC-Web protocols
- All RPC procedures follow /service.ServiceName/MethodName URL pattern
