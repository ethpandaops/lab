# Xatu Public Contributors Proto

Protocol Buffer definitions and generated gRPC bindings for tracking Ethereum node contributors and aggregating network statistics.

## Key Integration Pattern

- **Multi-network aggregation**: Supports configurable time windows and Redis-based state persistence across networks
- **Geolocation tracking**: Comprehensive geographic data (countries, cities, continents) with node count statistics
- **Multi-processor architecture**: Supports Users (time-series), User Summaries, and Country Data processors with independent state tracking

## Important Constraints

- Generated .pb.go and _grpc.pb.go files must not be manually edited - regenerate via protoc when .proto changes
- Service currently has empty method definitions (placeholder for future RPC implementations)
- Time window configurations mirror Python config structure for compatibility with existing infrastructure
