# Lab Service

Main aggregation service that consolidates frontend configuration from multiple Ethereum data sources and service modules.

## Key Integration Patterns

- **Service orchestration**: Coordinates multiple specialized services (beacon chain timings, beacon slots, xatu contributors) through dependency injection
- **Frontend config aggregation**: Centralizes frontend module configurations with network-specific Ethereum fork data
- **Metrics standardization**: Uses consistent API metrics patterns with request counters and duration histograms
- **Ethereum network abstraction**: Handles multiple Ethereum networks with network-specific genesis times and fork configurations

## Critical Constraints

- Always defer metrics recording in API methods with proper error status tracking
- Use consistent service naming with ServiceName constant pattern
- Frontend configs must include all active module configurations via FrontendModuleConfig() calls
- Network configurations require proper fork epoch handling with client version constraints
