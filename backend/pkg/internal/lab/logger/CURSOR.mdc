Logger factory that creates service-specific logrus instances with standardized configuration and service field injection.

- Use the New() function to create loggers with service name field for consistent log identification
- Configure TextFormatter with FullTimestamp for consistent timestamp formatting across services
- Always validate and parse log levels before setting to ensure proper error handling
- Return FieldLogger interface to maintain abstraction and enable service field pre-injection
