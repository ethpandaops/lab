Generic typed state storage that provides Get/Set operations over a cache backend with JSON serialization and namespace isolation.

- Use Go generics for type-safe state operations: `Client[T any]` for specific types
- Always include namespace configuration to prevent key conflicts between modules  
- Handle JSON serialization/deserialization errors explicitly with meaningful error messages
- Return `ErrNotFound` for cache misses to distinguish from other errors
- Test both value types and pointer types for generic type safety
