Ethereum beacon chain client that manages multiple networks with wallclock synchronization, network specification parsing, and comprehensive metrics.

- Use Network struct for per-network state with thread-safe access via mutex
- Fetch network specifications from remote URLs with context-based timeouts (5s for network start, 10s default)
- Initialize ethwallclock.EthereumBeaconChain using spec values (genesis time, seconds per slot, slots per epoch)
- Always instrument wallclock events (slot/epoch changes) with Prometheus metrics per network
- Validate network configs before starting and ensure graceful error handling for network failures
