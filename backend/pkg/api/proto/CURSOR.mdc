# Lab API Protocol Definitions

Core protocol buffer definitions for the Lab API service that bridges frontend and backend communication.

## Primary Purpose
Defines read-only API endpoints for beacon slot data, locally built blocks, and frontend configuration.

## Key Integration Pattern
- All API methods marked as IdempotencyNoSideEffects (read-only operations)
- Uses Connect-RPC framework for multi-protocol support (Connect, gRPC, gRPC-Web)
- Imports beacon_slots and lab proto definitions for data consistency

## Important Constraints  
- Generated .pb.go files are auto-generated - DO NOT EDIT manually
- All endpoints must maintain backward compatibility
- Proto definitions must follow established naming patterns: {MethodName}Request/Response
