# Protocol Connect Bindings

Generated Connect-RPC client and server bindings for Lab API protobuf definitions.

## Key Constraints
- **Generated Code**: This file is auto-generated by protoc-gen-connect-go - DO NOT EDIT manually
- **Protocol Support**: Implements Connect, gRPC, and gRPC-Web protocols with binary Protobuf and JSON codecs
- **Idempotency**: All API methods are marked as IdempotencyNoSideEffects (read-only operations)

## Integration Pattern
- Uses Connect-RPC framework for type-safe client/server communication
- Provides both LabAPIClient interface for consumers and LabAPIHandler interface for implementers
- Automatically handles protocol negotiation and compression
