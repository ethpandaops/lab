# Golang Best Pracices

When developing the Go codebase, you must adhere to industry standard/best practices for backend and Golang. 

## Libraries
Use the following libraries:
- sirupsen/logrus for logging

## Structure
- Only use interfaces when absolutely required, or if they're beneficial for testing purposes. Structs should have a clearly defined 
seperation of concerns, and be small and testable. 
- When you create a new struct, interface, or feature, you should create tests in an equivalent side file.
  - E.g. if you create 'store.go', also create 'store_test.go'
- It is VERY important to not stutter in your package and structure naming. For example:
  - 'service/store/store.go.Store' - BAD
  - 'service/store.go.Store' - GOOD
- NEVER create packages that hold abstract contents. Definitions should live close to their related structs.
  - 'package/config/store.go' - DOGSHIT
  - 'package/store/{store.go, config.go}' - GOOD
  - 'utils/' - DOGSHIT. NEVER do this.
  - 'types/' - DOGSHIT. NEVER do this.
