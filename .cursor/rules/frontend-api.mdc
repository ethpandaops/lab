The frontend interacts with a GRPC gateway. The GRPC gateway is defined here:
`./backend/pkg/api/proto/proto.yaml`

Typescript types are automatically generated -- you will never need to create them yourself. They are generated in to:
`./frontend/src/api/proto/`.

The API interface is defined in here:
`./frontend/src/api/proto/labapi/`. Inspect these files, and work your way backwards to find the raw types if needed.

An example using these types can be found here:
`./frontend/src/api/example-usage.ts`
