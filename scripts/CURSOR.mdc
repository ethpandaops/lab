# Scripts Component

Development and build automation utilities for ETHPandaOps Lab project.

## Key Patterns
- All scripts use `set -e` for fail-fast error handling
- Scripts validate required parameters and provide usage instructions
- External dependencies are validated before execution
- Generated files include clear auto-generation warnings

## Important Constraints
- Scripts must be executable and include proper shebang lines
- Always validate external URLs and resources before fetching
- Use relative paths for project-internal operations
- Include cleanup and error recovery where appropriate
